Sure, here is an example of a replication policy for an on-premise server migration to Azure using Azure Site Recovery (ASR):

# Create a replication policy for your server
$ReplicationPolicyName = "MyReplicationPolicy"
$PolicyArgs = @{
    Name = $ReplicationPolicyName
    RecoveryPointRetentionRangeInHours = 24
    ApplicationConsistentSnapshotFrequencyInHours = 4
    InitialReplicationDurationInHours = 24
}
New-AzureRmSiteRecoveryPolicy -InputObject $PolicyArgs
