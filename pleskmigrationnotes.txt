Additionally, the Plesk Migrator distribution includes the schema.json file listing all available hosting description parameters. It can be found in the following directories:

(Linux) /usr/local/psa/admin/plib/modules/panel-migrator/backend/lib/python/parallels/plesk/hosting_description/
(Windows) %plesk_dir%admin\plib\modules\panel-migrator\backend\lib\python\parallels\plesk\hosting_description\

What is checked
The file is validated successfully if all of the below are true:

The hosting description file exists and is readable.
The hosting description file is a valid YAML or JSON file.
The hosting description file structure is valid (for example, ‘login’ and ‘password’ fields are supplied for every declared customer account).
Certain conditions for the objects to be migrated are met (for example, every mailbox to be migrated belongs to a domain).
All the files and directories to be migrated are present on the file system.
Manual hosting description file validation
To validate your hosting description file without initiating a migration, run the following commands:

On Linux:
/usr/local/psa/admin/sbin/modules/panel-migrator/plesk-migrator validate
On Windows:
%plesk_dir%admin/plib/modules/panel-migrator/backend/plesk-migrator.bat validate
