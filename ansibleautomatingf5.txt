Ansible automating F5 Big IP

Automation model powered by ansible 

Adding nodes to an F5 Big-IP Load balancer
-automated tasks, less scalable

environment example
Amazon VPC ROuter
1. connects directly to the ansible tower
2. connects to the f5 virtual edition - then connects to host1 and host2 in the web server

Ansible PLaybook example script below
1 ---
2 - name: BIG-IP SETUP
3   hosts: lb           //load balancer, could be loads of loads balancers
4   connection: local
5   gather_facts: false
6
7   tasks:              //what we want the playbook to perform
8     - name: CREATE NODES
9       bigip_node:     //draw on the bigip node module that will power it all 
10        provider:     //description of parameters that call out details of running the tasks, to add the two nodes to the big IP load balancer
11          server: "{{private_ip}}"
12          user:  "{{ansible_user}}"
13          password: "{{ansible_ssh_pass}}"
14          server_port: 8443
15          validate_certs: false
16         hosts: "{{hostvars[item].ansible_host}}"
17         name: "{{hostvars[item].inventory_hostname}}"
18         loop: "{{ groups['web'] }}"

Ansible Tower interface online 
add nodes from the add node template 

save playbook as a .yml file 
yellow represents what was changed and the green shows status of ok changes 

launch node template to add more nodes, ansible will tell us we already have 2 nodes because its based on teh defined state of the playbook you definded
